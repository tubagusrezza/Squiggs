      <p>
        Bitcoin first made its debut for trading at the beginning of July 2010
        at a price of $0.0008 per token.Bitcoin had a price of zero when it was
        introduced in 2009. On July 17, 2010, its price jumped to $.09. That's
        just eight-hundredths of a penny. If we make the hypothetical assumption
        that there were no transaction fees, a $100 investment on its debut day
        could have purchased 125,000 Bitcoin. Back in 2010, users could mine
        bitcoins with CPUs, meaning they could mine the digital currency on
        their home computer. The first block mined with a person using GPUs
        happened in July 2010. What if I invested $1,000 in Bitcoin in 2010?
        This means that if you had invested $1000 at $. 08 in Bitcoin in 2010
        that investment would be worth over $287 million dollars today.
